Installation
============

python-colormath2 currently requires Python 3.7+. There are no
plans to add support for earlier versions of Python. The only other
requirements are NumPy_ and networkx_.

For those on Linux/Unix Mac OS, the easiest route will be :command:`pip` ::

    pip install colormath2

If you are on Windows, you'll need to visit NumPy_, download their binary
distribution, then install colormath2.
